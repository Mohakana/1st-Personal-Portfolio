I had so much fun creating this document. It was my first time getting hands on with coding. It is not perfect it is my first and I am surely working towards improving my work as I have been told it looks more like a blog than a webpage. I am working towards improving my work and like I have mentioned in the document I will be proficient before the end of this year and it made me want to perform even better for my last projrct and familiarise myself with many other tools
