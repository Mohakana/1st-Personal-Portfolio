                <h1>WELCOME! üéâ</h1>
                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Lerato Mohakana, a 24-years-old first-year student at Belgium Campus ITversity, pursuing a Diploma in IT. My journey has been one of significant change, resilience, and passion. I dropped out of a Bachelor of Education in Foundation Phase Teaching last year, realising that my true calling lies in the world of software engineering.
                    <br><br>
                    I am deeply passionate about the power of AI and its ability to solve complex challenges. Coming from a township where qualifications in IT are rare, I aim to be part of the movement that brings technology and innovation to places like mine. I want to give back to my community by teaching the younger generation how to code, showing them why it‚Äôs essential to understand technology in 2025, where everything is becoming digital.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I‚Äôm focused on learning Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#, and I am determined to become proficient in these languages by the end of this year. However, as I am still working towards proficiency in these languages, I currently rely on AI to help create my portfolios and assist in coding tasks. I am eager to land an internship that will allow me to prove my skills and grow professionally.
                    <br><br>
                    As someone who thrives under pressure, I am a fast learner, consistent, and enjoy working in teams. I‚Äôm also working on developing my leadership skills and am open to volunteering opportunities that will help me improve my abilities in exchange for valuable experience and references.
                    <br><br>
                    I‚Äôve also enrolled in a short course through the PLP software engineering scholarship, which has further fuelled my commitment to giving my best effort in everything I do.
                    <br><br>
                    I‚Äôm excited for what the future holds and look forward to the chance to contribute to the tech industry, especially in ways that can benefit my community and South Africa as a whole. Let‚Äôs connect and build something great together!
                </p>

            <h1>My Education</h1>
            <p>In 2019, I began my academic journey at the University of the Free State, where I enrolled in the Bachelor of Education in Foundation Phase Teaching. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete my degree and ultimately made the decision to leave the programme. Though this chapter was left incomplete, it served as a learning experience that led me to reevaluate my passions and goals.
                <br><br>
                This year, I took a bold step towards a new path by enrolling in the Diploma in IT at Belgium Campus ITversity. My decision was driven by my newfound passion for technology, particularly AI, and my desire to explore the realms of creativity and innovation within the tech industry. I am excited about the possibilities that technology offers to solve problems and create meaningful impact, and I am committed to developing my skills in this dynamic field.

                    <p>The code is a simple HTML webpage designed to introduce and provide details about Lerato‚Äôs 1st Hackathon. The page includes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A welcome message explaining the purpose of the hackathon.</li>

                        <li>A registration form for attendees to enter their details.</li>
                        <li>A schedule table outlining key events for the hackathon.</li>

                    <p>I created this webpage as a practice project to improve my HTML skills and to get comfortable with structuring web content. This project helped me learn how to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Structure an HTML document properly (head, body, footer, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Use text elements like headings (h1 to h3) and paragraphs (p).</li>
                        <li>Create lists (ul, li) and tables (table, tr, td).</li>
                        <li>Build a simple form with input fields (input).</li>
                        <li>Link an external CSS file for styling (though the link has an error I need to fix).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><a href="https://2ndpratiseproject.netlify.app/">Practise-project-2</a></li>
                    <p>This website was influenced by PLP web technologies Assignment 2. It helped me familiarize myself a lot with HTML and how it operates and some of the attributes that are used in creating an HTML document.</p>
